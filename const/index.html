<!-- 
- Function expressions are not hoisted, which means you cannot call them before they are defined.
- They can be anonymous, but naming them can be useful for clarity in stack traces.
- When using **`const`**, the reference to the function cannot be changed (it's immutable). With **`var`** and
**`let`**, you can reassign the variable to a new function or value. -->
