### **`let`**

- **Explanation**: `let` allows you to declare variables that are block-scoped, meaning they exist only within the block they are defined in.
- **Difference from `var`**: Unlike `var`, which is function-scoped, `let` is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it's defined.
