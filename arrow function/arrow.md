# Explanation: Arrow functions provide a new way to write shorter function syntax.

*const add = (a, b) => a + b;*

- **Difference from traditional functions**:

    - **Syntax**: Arrow functions have a shorter syntax.
    - **`this` behavior**: In arrow functions, the value of `this` is determined by the surrounding lexical context. Traditional functions define their own `this` value.
