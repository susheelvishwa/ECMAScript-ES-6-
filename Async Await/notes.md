# async/await 
is a modern way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.

# Whatâ€™s an async operation ?

In JavaScript, certain operations (like fetching data from a server) don't complete immediately. Instead of blocking the rest of the code from running, JavaScript continues executing the next lines of code. This is where async/await comes into play, helping us manage these operations more intuitively.



**Summary :**

- **`async/await`** provides a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
- It works hand-in-hand with Promises, making the code look synchronous while still being asynchronous.
- The **`fetch`** API, combined with **`async/await`**, offers a straightforward way to handle network requests.
